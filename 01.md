# How Javascript works

In JavaScript, everything happens within an execution context. Think of it as a sealed container where the code is executed. The execution context holds information about the environment in which the current code is being executed.

Inside the container, there are two main components: the memory component and the code component. The memory component, also known as the variable environment, stores all variables and functions in key-value pairs. The code component, also known as the thread of execution, is where code is executed line by line.

JavaScript is a synchronous, single-threaded language. This means that only one command is executed at a time and in a specific order.

When a JavaScript program runs, a global execution context is created. The execution context is created in two phases: memory creation and code execution.

In the memory creation phase, JavaScript allocates memory to variables and functions. For example, in the code snippet below:

```javascript
var n = 5;
function square(num) {
  var ans = num * num;
  return ans;
}
var square2 = square(n);
var square4 = square(4);
```

JavaScript first allocates memory for the variable 'n' and assigns it the value 'undefined'. It then allocates memory for the 'square' function and stores the code of the function inside that memory space. It also allocates memory for the variables 'square2' and 'square4' and assigns them the value 'undefined'.

In the code execution phase, JavaScript goes through the code line by line. In the example above, it assigns the value 5 to the variable 'n'. For the 'square' function, there is nothing to execute as the memory has already been allocated in the memory creation phase.

When the line var square2 = square(n); is reached, a new execution context is created for the function. Memory is allocated for the variables 'num' and 'ans' and the value 'undefined' is assigned to them. In the code execution phase of this execution context, the value 2 is assigned to 'num' and 4 is assigned to 'ans'. The function then returns control to the line where it was invoked, and the function execution context is deleted. The same process is repeated for the 'square4' function and then, when it is finished, the global execution context is destroyed.
